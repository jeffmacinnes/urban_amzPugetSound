In Washington DC, 36 percent of residential land is zoned for single-family homes exclusively, and much of this land—such as the in-demand Northwest portion of the city—is within easy access of subway stations, ideal neighborhoods for denser construction. In 2021, DC passed <a href=\"https://dcist.com/story/21/05/19/after-years-of-arguing-dc-finally-has-an-amended-comprehensive-plan/\" target=\"_blank\">a comprehensive plan for zoning reform</a>, which seeks to increase the available housing density 15 percent by 2025.
