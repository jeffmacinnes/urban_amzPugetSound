In Washington DC, 36 percent of residential land is zoned for single-family homes exclusively, but much of this land—such as the in-demand Northwest portion of the city—is within easy access of subway stations, ideal neighborhoods for denser construction. In 2021, DC passed <a href=\"https://dcist.com/story/21/05/19/after-years-of-arguing-dc-finally-has-an-amended-comprehensive-plan/\" target=\"_blank\">a comprehensive plan for zoning reform</a>, which seeks to increase the available housing density 15 percent by 2025. And in Washington state, A and B zoning reforms were passed this spring."},{"type":"text","value":"But to address the full scope of the housing shortage, more changes are needed. Policymakers can target zoning changes near public transit stations to encourage more affordable housing by decreasing future residents’ transportation costs.
