The housing market has inadequate supply to meet the demands of a growing population, with an estimated shortage of <a href=\"https://www.fanniemae.com/research-and-insights/perspectives/us-housing-shortage\" target=\"_blank\">3.8 million houses for rent or sale in 2019</a>. Zoning ordinances implemented by local governments <a href=\"https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/indana96&div=16&id=&page=\" target=\"_blank\">sometimes hinder</a> new development, contributing to rising home prices and <a href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2022/03/15/as-rents-soar-states-take-aim-at-local-zoning-laws\" target=\"_blank\">ballooning rents</a> nationwide."}],"body":[{"type":"text","value":"Many cities across the nation are already exploring these types of changes in the face of continued obstacles to construction in the zoning code. In Washington DC, 36 percent of residential land is zoned for single-family homes exclusively, but much of this land—such as the in-demand Northwest portion of the city—is within easy access of subway stations, ideal neighborhoods for denser construction. In 2021, DC passed <a href=\"https://dcist.com/story/21/05/19/after-years-of-arguing-dc-finally-has-an-amended-comprehensive-plan/\" target=\"_blank\">a comprehensive plan for zoning reform</a>, which seeks to increase the available housing density 15 percent by 2025. And in Washington state, A and B zoning reforms were passed this spring."},{"type":"text","value":"But to address the full scope of the housing shortage, more changes are needed. Policymakers can target zoning changes near public transit stations to encourage more affordable housing by decreasing future residents’ transportation costs. They can reduce costs even further by <a href=\"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/S2044-994120140000005011./full/html\" target=\"_blank\">eliminating parking requirements</a> for new developments."},{"type":"text","value":"Making these changes may raise concerns from residents. In Nashville for example, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ejmotycka/status/1611158729503965185?s=20&t=AYqGczptgWGQC3N1HxjCCQ\" target=\"_blank\">a recent redevelopment proposal</a> would build 480 apartments on the site of an under-utilized business center. But in a resident townhall, some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ejmotycka/status/1611170562671353856?s=20&t=AYqGczptgWGQC3N1HxjCCQ\" target=\"_blank\">locals noted their opposition</a> because they felt the plans didn’t incorporate enough parking and feared more units would lead to more traffic. But evidence suggests that parking is <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01944363.2020.1864225\" target=\"_blank\">routinely oversupplied because of zoning requirements</a>—and that new development <a href=\"https://www.arlingtonva.us/files/sharedassets/public/Projects/Documents/Historic-Traffic-Counts.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">doesn’t have to lead to more traffic</a> if it is accompanied with robust transit options."},{"type":"text","value":"<b>Below, we display how the four zoning changes we explored above could expand potential housing development near transit in the Puget Sound region—including Seattle and nearby cities</b>. Although we use the Puget Sound region to illustrate the effects of these changes, similar policies could be applied in communities across the country."},{"type":"text","value":"To see how zoning changes can affect housing density, first select a policy change and a city or county in the region. For each transit station in that jurisdiction, we show the current housing density as a <span class=\"gray\">gray</span> bar, with the additional allowable housing under that zoning change as a <span class=\"yellow\">yellow</span> bar stacked above it.
